Just my own copies of implementing examples while taking the https://graphacademy.neo4j.com/courses/llm-fundamentals/ course.
This has helped me understand the concepts better though i might be late to the party. 

This folder will contain only examples on langchain's interaction with an LLM and not use any graph DBs.
